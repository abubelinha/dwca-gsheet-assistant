The compressed files (named **Darwin Core Archives**) may be transfered to user's [Zenodo](www.zenodo.org) profile if configured and user's data will not be transfer to others unless explicity described in this document.

Darwin Core Archives are basically a ZIP compressed files composed by a **Ecological Metadata Language** file, a `meta.xml` file describing the relationships between records in datasets and a set a of **comma separated values** (CSV) files corresponding to the biodiversity data itself. The Add-on need access to user's Google Drive to read, write and modify theses files and create a compressed file (the Darwin Core Archive), which optionally can be transfered to user's Zenodo account.

We may receive certain information about you from the provider of the third-party application.

We may use (in application only) some of those information shared by the provider of the connected third-party application:
-Your user ID number (like your Google ID number), which may be linked to publicly-available information like your name and profile photo.

The Add-on needs permission to read, write and modify user's Google Drive, as described above, in order to create and manage **Darwin Core Archives**.

## External Requests and Zenodo

The Add-on access external resources (outside Google API domains) in order to collect the most updated version of [Darwin Core Standard Schema[(https://dwc.tdwg.org/xml/tdwg_dwcterms.xsd)] and other *Metadata Standards* as configured by user in the Add-on settings. The Add-on do not share any user's data with these third-party websites and applications. 

The **Zenodo** integration is essentially optional, and the user can enable or disabled it from the Add-on settings. Once enabled the Add-on will transfered the **Darwin Core Archive** (compressed file) from user's Google Drive to configured Zenodo account. We do not share any user's data with Zenodo, and only use the provided **Zenodo API Token** to access user's account and to create a dataset deposition into Zenodo.

# User Files

Our services integrates with Google Drive. When you work with a file stored on Google Drive, your browser directly interacts with that service. We use standard Google Drive sharing functionality when you decide to share the file, and standard Google Drive authentication, authorization mechanisms for access control.

**All data collected by the Add-on will only be used in the scope of the Add-on to provide to the users a simpler method to create Darwin Core Archives and to share their biodiversity datasets with any person which they explicity granted access**
