# Rationale

Most biologists and biodiversity data managers organize their data into spreadsheets and for thoses whom are not familiary with Information Science practices of data standardization, the usage of complex software to assist the creation of standardized datasets can be painful, or even prohibited.

Based on that, the Google Sheet Add-on available here searches to explore the familiarity of the users with spreadsheets and allow them to create and publish standardized biodiversity data using Darwin Core Standard.
The add-on aims to provided a simple and intuitive interface for users not familiary with the concepts of Darwin Core Standard (DwC) and data sharing using Darwin Core Archives. 

The data in a spreadsheet can be easily mapped to DwC terms and the add-on can handle one-to-many relations between data records by the use of `CORE_ID` special *term*.

**NOTE:** the add-on is still in process of publication into Google Suite MarketPlace. But, it can be accessed and tested using the follow link: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w00npqUmmwramfPFYwljWFPi28chiCrSKSaKMQJXwPA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w00npqUmmwramfPFYwljWFPi28chiCrSKSaKMQJXwPA/edit?usp=sharing).
